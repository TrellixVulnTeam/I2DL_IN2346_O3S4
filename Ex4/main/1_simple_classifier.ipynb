It is worth having a look at the basis class <code>Network</code> in the file <code>exercise_code/networks/base_networks.py</code>. We will make use of the <code>__call__()</code> method, which computes the forward and backward pass of your classifier. In a similar manner, we use the <code>__call__()</code> function for our Loss function.</p>\n","</div>\n","\n","The following cell performs training with 400 training steps:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":59,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4UaMv5ZXY21g","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1653642611148,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":575,"user":{"displayName":"Umaid Bin Zubair","userId":"04715560925550446121"}},"outputId":"cf5b7cea-8072-49e3-c7a1-c52c1fec723d"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Epoch  0 --- Average Loss:  0.6931952940067676\n","Epoch  10 --- Average Loss:  0.6857946386752704\n","Epoch  20 --- Average Loss:  0.678678756983829\n","Epoch  30 --- Average Loss:  0.6717725236134877\n","Epoch  40 --- Average Loss:  0.6650655209160695\n","Epoch  50 --- Average Loss:  0.6585512309597763\n","Epoch  60 --- Average Loss:  0.652223452569879\n","Epoch  70 --- Average Loss:  0.6460761046329287\n","Epoch  80 --- Average Loss:  0.6401032275768868\n","Epoch  90 --- Average Loss:  0.6342989944256607\n","Epoch  100 --- Average Loss:  0.6286577204103649\n","Epoch  110 --- Average Loss:  0.62317387062031\n","Epoch  120 --- Average Loss:  0.6178420658053926\n","Epoch  130 --- Average Loss:  0.6126570864902833\n","Epoch  140 --- Average Loss:  0.6076138755716339\n","Epoch  150 --- Average Loss:  0.6027075395725715\n","Epoch  160 --- Average Loss:  0.5979333487262004\n","Epoch  170 --- Average Loss:  0.5932867360528878\n","Epoch  180 --- Average Loss:  0.588763295585977\n","Epoch  190 --- Average Loss:  0.5843587798883735\n","Epoch  200 --- Average Loss:  0.5800690969891076\n","Epoch  210 --- Average Loss:  0.5758903068552539\n","Epoch  220 --- Average Loss:  0.5718186175010208\n","Epoch  230 --- Average Loss:  0.5678503808228264\n","Epoch  240 --- Average Loss:  0.5639820882370234\n","Epoch  250 --- Average Loss:  0.5602103661857649\n","Epoch  260 --- Average Loss:  0.5565319715664128\n","Epoch  270 --- Average Loss:  0.5529437871308838\n","Epoch  280 --- Average Loss:  0.5494428168933815\n","Epoch  290 --- Average Loss:  0.5460261815780151\n","Epoch  300 --- Average Loss:  0.5426911141317895\n","Epoch  310 --- Average Loss:  0.5394349553232765\n","Epoch  320 --- Average Loss:  0.5362551494428555\n","Epoch  330 --- Average Loss:  0.5331492401166684\n","Epoch  340 --- Average Loss:  0.5301148662432714\n","Epoch  350 --- Average Loss:  0.5271497580593237\n","Epoch  360 --- Average Loss:  0.5242517333384513\n","Epoch  370 --- Average Loss:  0.5214186937256059\n","Epoch  380 --- Average Loss:  0.5186486212077477\n","Epoch  390 --- Average Loss:  0.5159395747204676\n"]}],"source":["from exercise_code.networks.optimizer import *\n","from exercise_code.networks.classifier import *\n","# Hyperparameter Setting, we will specify the loss function we use, and implement the optimizer we finished in the last step.\n","num_features = 1\n","\n","# initialization\n","model = Classifier(num_features=num_features)\n","model.initialize_weights()\n","\n","loss_func = BCE() \n","learning_rate = 5e-1\n","loss_history = []\n","opt = Optimizer(model,learning_rate)\n","\n","steps = 400\n","# Full batch Gradient Descent\n","for i in range(steps):\n","    \n","    # Enable your model to store the gradient.\n","    model.train()\n","    \n","    # Compute the output and gradients w.r.t weights of your model for the input dataset.\n","    model_forward, model_backward = model(X_train)\n","    \n","    # Compute the loss and gradients w.r.t output of the model.\n","    loss, loss_grad = loss_func(model_forward, y_train)\n","    \n","    # Use back prop method to get the gradients of loss w.r.t the weights.\n","    grad = loss_grad * model_backward\n","    \n","    # Compute the average gradient over your batch\n","    grad = np.mean(grad, 0, keepdims = True)\n","\n","    # After obtaining the gradients of loss with respect to the weights, we can use optimizer to\n","    # do gradient descent step.\n","    # Take transpose to have the same shape ([D+1,1]) as weights.\n","    opt.step(grad.T)\n","    \n","    # Average over the loss of the entire dataset and store it.\n","    average_loss = np.mean(loss)\n","    loss_history.append(average_loss)\n","    if i%10 == 0:\n","        print(\"Epoch \",i,\"--- Average Loss: \", average_loss)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nvi9zXedY21h"},"source":["We can see that our average loss is decreasing as expected.
